Data Contains lots of json file, it will be very dangerous, don't touch it will be good

Use Multi Process to speed up generate data section (speed up half of time in my experiment: 71 sec to 40 sec for 10 batches)
-> however the bottleneck will still be the I/O section since json is not as fast as other binary format.
